But, we can imagine that if more years pass with the same present-day climate, there would be different but similar maximum temperatures in future February days. From the data we observe, we can try to estimate the **average maximum February temperature** in this imaginary collection of all future February days that would occur in our modern climate, assuming the climate doesn't change any further and many years pass.\n",

Treating actual observations of natural events as if they were each *randomly* sampled from some unknown distribution is a simplifying assumption. These temperatures were not actually sampled at random—instead they occurred due to the complex interactions of the Earth's climate—but treating them as if they were random abstracts away the details of this naturally occuring process and allows us to carry out statistical inference.  Conclusions are only as valid as the assumptions upon which they rest, but in this case thinking of daily temperatures as random samples from some unknown climate distribution seems at least plausible.\n",

We will compare this confidence interval to the historical average (ie. the `\"Past\"` value in our `monthly_increases` table). How will we do the comparison? Well, since we are essentially interested in seeing if the average February max daily temperatures have ***changed*** since the past, we care about whether the historical average lies within the confidence interval we create. \n",
